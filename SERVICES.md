FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
FROM node:18-alpine AS runtime
```

### Orchestration
- **Kubernetes**: Production deployment with auto-scaling
- **Docker Compose**: Local development environment
- **Helm Charts**: Environment-specific configuration

### Scaling Policies
- **CPU-based**: Scale when CPU usage > 70%
- **Memory-based**: Scale when memory usage > 80%
- **Queue-based**: Scale based on Redis queue depth
- **Custom**: Business logic-based scaling triggers
